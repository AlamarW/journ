## About the Project
journ, the journaling app, started as a project to mimic much of the functionality of the website 750words.com but to make the data local for the users instead of in a cloud. It started to feel weird to me with how much personal stuff I was journaling with on a site with a backend that was not in my control, even considering the seemingly good intentions of the small team working on it.

Since conception of the project, I've deviated a bit from the clone of 750words.com goal and am dedicating myself to a "fully featured" journaling app in the terminal. The core of journ is that I don't want to take your default text editor from you. People who like to do things in their terminal have their editor of choice (I use neovim btw) and so journ defaults to whatever you have it set up as.

It's helpful to have a word counter in your text editor of choice, but journ will take care of that for you if not.

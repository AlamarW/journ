## About the Project
journ, the journaling app, started as a project to mimic much of the functionality of the website 750words.com but to make the data local for the users instead of in a cloud. It started to feel weird to me with how much personal stuff I was journaling with on a site with a backend that was not in my control, even considering the seemingly good intentions of the small team working on it.

Since conception of the project, I've deviated a bit from the clone of 750words.com goal and am dedicating myself to a "fully featured" journaling app in the terminal.
